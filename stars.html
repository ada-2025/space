            <h1>Stars</h1>

            <h2>How Stars are Formed</h2>
            <p>Stars are formed when large clouds of gas and dust in space, called molecular clouds, collapse under their own gravity, causing dense clumps to form that eventually heat up and ignite nuclear fusion reactions at their core, becoming a star.</p>

            <h2>Terms To Know</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Molecular Clouds: Clouds that are cold and full of dust</li>
                <li>Gravitational collapse: Within the clouds denser reigions of it start to collpase under their own gravity creating smaller, denser clumps</li>
                <li>Protostar: This collapsin clump of gas and dust is called the Protostar</li>
                <li>Nuclear Fusion: As the protostar continues to contract, its core heats up until it reaches the temperature and pressure required for nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing energy that makes the star shine.</li>
                <li>Stellar Nurseries: Regions within galaxies where active star formation occurs are called stellar nurseries.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why Stars Shine Bright At Night</h2>
            <p>A star glows because a star releases  a huge glowing ball of hot gas. Then Deep inside its core, tons of hydrogen atoms smash together, forming helium and releasing huge amounts of energy that heats the gas to make the star shine. This is called Nuclear Fusion</p>
